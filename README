 Inspired by "sc" and Andrew M. Kuchling's excellent "tabview.py" app, 
 this is a simple Python spreadsheet using curses. 

 NOTE - (as at 22nd June 2012) -  The scrolling code was not working for a long time. 
I have now got this working again and will push up a new version of the spreadsheet 
code soon. 

 To exit the spreadsheet, press Ctrl-G. 
 
 As usual, this is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
