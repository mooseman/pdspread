 Inspired by "sc" and Andrew M. Kuchling's excellent "tabview.py" app, 
 this is a simple Python spreadsheet using curses. 

 Acknowledgement: This code would not have been possible without 
 Andrew M. Kuchling's excellent "tabview.py" app. Some code from 
 that application is used here. Very many thanks to Andrew for 
 doing that application!   
 Also, very many thanks to those in pythonforum.org who have helped
 me with my questions there. 
 Many thanks also to "bvdet" from bytes.com. The matrix code in this 
 app is based on the code that he posted here -

 To exit the spreadsheet, press Ctrl-G. 
 
 As usual, this is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
