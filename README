 Inspired by "sc" and Andrew M. Kuchling's excellent "tabview.py" app, 
 this is a simple Python spreadsheet using curses. 

 Acknowledgement: This code would not have been possible without 
 Andrew M. Kuchling's excellent "tabview.py" app. Some code from 
 that application is used here. Very many thanks to Andrew for 
 doing that application!   

 To exit the spreadsheet, press Ctrl-G. 
 
 As usual, this is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
